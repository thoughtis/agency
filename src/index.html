      Whether it’s a patient’s first time meeting with a doctor or they’re attending their annual check-up, there are a few things they need to keep in mind when they prepare for a doctor’s visit. Ways to Prepare Prior to the Appointment Arrive On Time to the Doctor’s Appointment Care providers are often scheduled to see multiple patients a day while navigating around a busy schedule. In order for you to maximize the time you have with your provider, it’s important to arrive on time to the doctor’s office and avoid feeling rushed during your visit. It’s even better to show up to your appointment approximately 10-15 minutes early so there’s ample time for a nurse to check your vitals (height, weight, blood pressure, etc.) prior to seeing the doctor. To help keep you on schedule, record your appointment date and time on a calendar or in a planner once it’s made so you can incorporate it into your day. Inform the Doctor’s Office of Accommodations Before arriving at your appointment, it’s important to think through any accommodations the office should prepare for you. Such accommodations may include handicap parking or assistance, the help of an interpreter, the help of a translator, etc. If any such accommodations would be helpful during your visit, it’s important to call the office ahead of time so they can arrange everything accordingly for when you arrive. Ensure the Office Takes Your Insurance When it comes to finances, insurance plays a large role. Before finalizing an appointment with a provider or specialist, it’s important to ensure that the office accepts your primary form of insurance. Doing so will help you to avoid extra charges or fees for physicians that aren’t in your network. Oak Street Health locations accept a wide range of insurance providers and have a Care Team that’s ready and willing to walk their patients through their insurance benefits. To learn more about various insurance plans and what they provide, visit this source. Route Your Trip Before making an appointment, it’s important to plan your route and see where an office is located in relation to your home. Route how far it is to drive to the provider location or which public transportation options are available to take you there. Many insurance plans offer rides via services such as Uber or Lyft to assist their patients if necessary. Oak Street Health also provides transportation to and from appointments via company vans or rideshare services like Lyft, if needed. Record Your Questions/Concerns When finally meeting with the doctor, it can be overwhelming and easy to forget all of the questions or concerns you wanted to address. Prior to your appointment, it can be helpful to record a list of questions you want to ask, comments you want to make, or concerns you want to address with your doctor. When you’re finally at your visit, simply pull out the paper list or notes you made on your phone so you can mention all that was on your mind and receive the appropriate medical advice and treatment plan. Items to Bring to the Appointment Bring Items For the Waiting Room There are going to be a variety of items you may need to bring along with you to your doctor’s appointment. Have a bag set aside that can carry all of your belongings, including a couple of items to entertain you while waiting to see the doctor. At times, there may be a wait prior to seeing your care provider. To help bide time, it’s good to bring a book, crossword puzzle, magazine, or other items along with you to keep you occupied. Prepare for a Doctor’s Visit by Printing Out Test Results Especially when establishing a relationship with a new provider, it’s important to have all prior medical tests and results printed out and documented for your visit. Pertinent test results may include but are not limited to past mammograms, colonoscopies, vaccination records, blood tests, and more. Don’t leave anything out and let the provider decide what’s relevant or not, that way they have a broad scope of understanding about your health history and care. Gather Family Records Family medical history can have a large impact on your current health and wellbeing. Compile all family medical records or a list of familial health conditions for your doctor to see. Certain conditions may be genetic, inciting a need for certain preventative health measures or screenings to be taken with your care. If possible, talk with family members, such as mothers or fathers, about their health history and any medical incidences they’ve struggled with. Knowing any familial medical issues can aid you in maintaining a healthy lifestyle throughout the years ahead. Compile All Past & Current Medications to Bring Make a list of any past or current medications for your provider to see, including dosage levels and how frequently you are taking them. If taking multiple medications, bring the bottles or packs in with you, even if they’re expired or empty. Having all medications laid out in front of them, allows a provider to check for duplicates, see if any refills are necessary, and generally aid the patient in organizing their medicinal routine. Furthermore, it’s important to be honest with the provider about which medications you’re on, why you’re on them, and how often you are truly taking them as it plays a large role in your healthcare. Don’t be afraid to explain hesitancies, ask questions, or talk through any side effects or concerns you have surrounding any medications you’re on or recommended to be on.
